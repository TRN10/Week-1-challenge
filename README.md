# <Week 1 Challenge>

Refactoring existing code using semantic HTML.

The purpose of this challenge is to refactor existing code using semantic HTML.

Updating the the HTML with semantic elements ensures that the code adheres to accessibility standards, providing alternative descriptions of images and icons.

The code is easier to read with easilly identifiable and descriptive sections.

Updating the code with semantic HTML optimises it for search engines.

This challenge taught me the importance of reconciling changes in HTML with CSS as soon as they are made and ensuring that they work. I made the mistake of changing all of the HTML first and then trying to fix the CSS file afterwards.
